# Raid Shadow Legends Clan Boss Speed Tune Simulation

This tool allows you to calculate speeds to achieve different speed ratios in clan boss.



## How to Use

This Tool is seperated into few sections:

1. Config file
    -- This file specifies the settings for the simulations.

2. Champions files
    * These Files controls what your champions do. You can specify logic behind the champion's skills and set their cooldowns and delays.

3. Clan boss file
    ** This file content is called every time the clan boss takes their turn in the simulation and it can be used to check is the speed tune is still valid or has it failed.

4. Main loop file
    -    This file specifies how the simulations should be ran.

5. Simulation file
    > This file does the actual simulation and it's logic.
